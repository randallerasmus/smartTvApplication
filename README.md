SmartTvApplication

Smart TV Application that will allow you to navigate
through a number of photos from different topics (e.g wallpapers, nature, etc) using the
Unsplash API, and when a menu item (topic) is selected, it retrieves topic photos from an API
and displays it in a horizontally scrolling grid.

Platform Support
This will be run in a Smart TV environment, for the purposes of this test you can assume that if
the app runs in latest versions of Safari, Firefox and Chrome it will run on the TV. The app will
run at a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080. (This can be fixed, but our preference is responsive)
